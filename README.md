## What it does
Lets friends listen to Spotify together! Songs can be added to the queue and listeners can vote to skip a song.

## How we built it
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using JQuery and AJAX.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of challenges working around the flaws of the Spotify API. We had to continue to come up with creative ways to implement the features that we wanted with the tools we were given. Another challenge was the voting system. Since the server didn't talk back to the clients, we had to come up with a unique system in which the clients control the voting system.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the voting system because it took a lot of creativity and effort from all members of the team to accomplish. We had to work around the 1 way communications of our database to implement this feature.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about AJAX and using APIs.
